# RECCAP2-ocean regions 

We have used the biomes of Fay and McKinley to divide the basins into subregions. 
The areas where FM14 does not have data have been ingested by the neighboring biome or a new distinct biome has been added, as noted in the figure below.

## How the map was created
Below is a map of the proposed regions for RECCAP v2. Note that the coastal boundaries have not been added to this map. 

The map is annotated to show how boundaries were decided. WOA09 uses the [World Ocean Atlas 09 basins map](https://iridl.ldeo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.NOAA/.NODC/.WOA09/.Masks/.basin/data.nc). FM14 indicates Fay and McKinley (2014) boundaries were used.

## Coastal ocean

For the coastal ocean, we could use the COSCATs coastal regions as a mask (Laurelle et al. 2013). The map below was made from the shapefile and converted to a binned 1Â° map. 

Note that this has not been discussed and is only a suggestion! Further topics for discussion include how coastal ocean will be integrated with open ocean flux estimates.
